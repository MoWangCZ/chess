# Chess

Practice project to create a simple chess program. The idea for this program came from conversations with my [Brother](https://github.com/Koldenblue) who was learning to program, and has written a [Chess program in python](https://github.com/Koldenblue/python-chess-game) at the time of this project's beginning.

# Goals
Practice the following concepts:
- Object Oriented Programming
- Polymorphism
- c++14 & c++17 features
- documentation
- Meson build system
- Unit testing
- github issue tracking and Pull Requests

Stretch Goals:
- re-create in multiple languages (Python, C#, Java?)
- Docker

There is currently no intention to create an AI or GUI.
